For every object , a unique is generated by JVM which is nothing but hashcode

hasCode dies not represent address of the object

JVM uses hashcode while saving object into hashing related data structure like hashtable, hashmap, hashset etc

The main advantage of  saving objects based on hashcode is search operation will become easy

the most powerful search algorithm up to today is hashing

If we are using object class hashcode, it will generate address of the object, it doesn't mean hashcode represents address of the object

Based on our requirement, we can override hashcode to generate our own hashcode

toSTring vs Hashcode()

If we are giving chance to object class toString() method, it internally calls hashcode() method,
but if we are overriding, it may not call hashcode()
