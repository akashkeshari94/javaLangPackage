The main objectives of wrapper classes are :
1.to wrap primitive into objects form so that we can handle primitive also just like objects
2. to define several utilities methods which are required for primitives

Constructors:
Almost all wrapper classes contains two constructors, one can take corresponding primitive
as argument and other can take String as argument
Integer I = new Integer(10)
Integer I = new Integer("10")

Double d = new Double(10.5)
Double d = new Double("10.5")


Integer I = new Integer("ten") --> If String argument not representing number, then we will get
RunTimeException saying NumberFormatException

Float class contains 3 constructors with float , double and String argument
Float d = new Float(10.5f)
Float d = new Float("10.5f")
Float d = new Float(10.5)
Float d = new Float("10.5")


Character class only one constructor which can take char argument
Character ch = new Character('a')
Character ch = new Character("a")//Compile time error

Boolean class contains two constructors, one can take primitive as argument and other can take String
argument. If we pass boolean primitive as argument, the only allowed values are true and false where
case is important and content is also important
Boolean b = new Boolean(true)
Boolean b = new Boolean(false)
Boolean b = new Boolean(True)//Compile time error
Boolean b = new Boolean(Akash)//Compile time error
