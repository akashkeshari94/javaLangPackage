Every method present in StringBuffer is synchronised, hence only one thread is allowed to operate
on stringBuffer object at a time which many create performance problem. to handle this problem,
Sun people introduced StringBuilder concept in 1.55 version

StringBuilder is exactly same as StringBuffer except following difference:

1. Every method in StringBuffer is synchronised but in StringBuilder , methods are non-synchronised

2. At a time, only one thread is allowed to operate on StringBuffer object and hence StringBuffer
object is thread safe but on StringBuilder object, at a time,  multiple threads are allowed to operate
and hence StringBuilder is not thread safe

3. Thread are required to wait to operate on StringBuffer object and hence relatively performance is
slow

4. StringBuffer was introduced in 1.0 version whereas StringBuilder came in 1.5 version


Except the above difference , everything is same in StringBuffer and StringBuilder including
methods and constructors

String vs StringBuffer vs StringBuilder

If the content is fixed and won't change frequently , then we should go for String

but if the content is not fixed and keep on changing but thread safety required, then we should go
for StringBuffer

If the content is not fixed and keep ion changing but thread safety is not required, then we should
go for StringBuilder
