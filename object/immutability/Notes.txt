Once We create an object, we can't perform any changes in that object,

If we are trying to perform any change and if there is any change in the content, so with those changes, a new object will be created.

If there is no change in the content, existing object will be reused , this behaviour  is nothing but immutability


We can create our own immutable class

final vs immutability

final is applicable for variable but not for objects whereas immutability applicable for object but not for variable

By declaring a reference variable as final , we won't get any immutability nature

Even though, reference eis the final, we can perform any type of change in the corresponding object, but we can not perform reassignmnet for the valuable

hence final and immutable both are different concept

final StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("akash");
sb.append("keshari");
System.out.println(sb);//akashkeshari

 // sb = new StringBuffer("lucky");//can not assign a value to a final variable
