If our class doesn't contain equals() method, Object class equals() method will be called

== operator is meant for reference comparison, equals() method is meant for content comparison

but default implementation of equals() method in Object class is reference comparisons only

SO Student s1= new Student("Akash", 101);
and Student s2= new Student("Akash", 101)

s1.equals(s2) will give false even though content is same but reference is different --> only when we have not overridden equals method
