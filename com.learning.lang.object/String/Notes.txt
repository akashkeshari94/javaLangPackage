String str = new String("Akash");--> in this case, two objects will created, one is heap are and another rin String Constant Pool,
str will be pointing to heap object

String str1="Akash" //In this case, only one obhject will be created in SCP and str1 will be always pointing that object


Object Creation in SCP is optional, first it will check if there is nay objkect already present in SCP with required content
If Object already present then existing object will be reused

If object not already available,m then only a new object will be created. This rule is only application for SCP and not for heap


garbage collector ius not allowed to access SCP area hence, even though object does not contain reference available, it is nit eligible for GC
if it is present in SCP area.

All SCP objects will be destroyed automatically at the time of JVM shutdown

String str1= new String("Akash");two objects will be created one is heap area and another in SCP
String str2= new String("Akash"); only one object will be created in heap and no object in SCP because already an object is available
 with the same content
String str3= "Akash"; //No objects will created
String st4= "Akash"; //No objects will created

So total 3 objects will be crated two in heap read and one in SCP

Whenever we are using new operator, compulsory a new object will be crate din heap area. Hence there may be a chance of existing two objects with
the same content in heap are but not in SCP, that is duplicate objects are posiible in heap are but not in SCP


For every string Constant, one obhect will be placed in SCP area

Because of some run time operation, if an object is required to create , that object will be placed onlky in yhe hep area but not in SCP are
