If the content is fixed and won't change frequently, then it is recommended to go for String

If content is not fixed snd keep on changing , then it is not recommended to use String, Because for
 every change , a new object will be recreated which affects the performance of the system

To handle this requirement , we should go for StringBuffer

The main advantage of StringBuffer over String is that all required change will be performed in the existing
 object only.
