If the content is fixed and won't change frequently, then it is recommended to go for String

If content is not fixed snd keep on changing , then it is not recommended to use String, Because for
 every change , a new object will be recreated which affects the performance of the system

To handle this requirement , we should go for StringBuffer

The main advantage of StringBuffer over String is that all required change will be performed in the existing
 object only.

 Constructors
 StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(); //initial capacity 16
 StringBuffer sb1 = new StringBuffer(int initialCapacity);

 StringBuffer sb1 = new StringBuffer(String s); //s.length+16
 Creates an equivalent StringBuffer with given String with capacity = s.length+16
